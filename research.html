Answers to these questions may trace back to an intense mass transfer phase, i.e., wind-Roche-lobe-overflow (WRLOF). Because WRLOF involves complex dust formation and (non-gray) radiation-hydrodynamics, the mass transfer efficiency $\beta$ and angular momentum loss efficiency $\gamma_{\rm am}$ are highly uncertain. Without accurate time-dependent knowledge of $\beta$ and $\gamma_{\rm am}$, the long-term orbital and chemical evolution cannot be known.

In Chen, Ivanova, and Carroll-Nellenback (2019) hereafter CIC19, we put forward a 3D radiation-hydrodynamic AGB binary model. This work has a simplified dust formation and destruction model, and also consider cooling through various processes. We first studied the isolated AGB star behavior, then put it in a binary setup. The ray-tracing radiation transfer track the optical depth $\tau$ from a surface that encloses the AGB star in a spherical coordinate. The model is capable of predicting the formation of circumbinary disks, spiral outflow, and accretion disks in AGB binaries. It also establishes a strong connection between the presence of a circumbinary disk and a much higher than the simple model predicted accretion rate. We find that the formation of a circumbinary disk is a result of an increase in the optical depth in equatorial region. The secondary focuses AGB wind onto the equator, thus increase the optical depth. This phenomenon can be observed if non-local radiation transfer is considered.

Among all the numerical hydrodynamical methods, Riemann solver is a widely used one in grid-based codes. In hydrodynamics, equation of state (EoS) is one of the equations that need to be solved. Much current research uses an EoS with a constant adiabatic index. This approximation may become questionable if phase transitions are important in astrophysical problems. The latent heat of the phases transitions maybe 10 times larger than the kinetic part of the internal energy. The first figure on the left shows the specific internal energy of pure hydrogen and perfect gas. In Chen et al. (2019), hereafter C19, we presented the first effective exact Riemann solver that can handle non-convex EoS. The EoS of pure hydrogen is non-convex because $\left(\pdv[2]{p}{\rho}\right)_{s}\ge0$ does not hold during hydrogen disassociation and ionization, where $s$ means the partial derivative is taken in constant specific entropy. An exact Riemann solver is important because it can gauge the approximate Riemann solvers that are used in codes. People use the approximate Riemann solvers instead of the exact ones in simulations because the approximate solvers are much cheaper. Therefore, C19 also presented an effective Harten-Lax-van Leer-Contact (HLLC) solver that can work with a general EoS in the Godunov scheme. The analytic hydrogen EoS solver in \citet{chen2019a} is both accurate and fast. Extension to include helium is straightforward.

They can lose mass via wind rapidly. When an AGB star is in a binary system, its wind can interact with the companion star (secondary). The ejected mass can be accreted by the secondary or remain gravitationally bound to the binary system or escape the binary system. Thus accretion discs and circumbinary discs may simultaneously exist in such systems.</p>

Dust formation and molecular cooling are also taken into consideration. We carry out six simulations varying in the outflow, separation and mass ratio. In our closest binary simulations, our models exemplify the wind Roche lobe overflow while in our wide binary cases, the mass transfer exhibits Bondi-Hoyle accretion. The morphologies of the outflows in the binary systems are varied. The variety may provide clues to how the late AGB phase influences planetary nebulae shaping. To attain the highest computational efficiency and the most stable results, all simulations are run in the corotating frame.

In this research, we studied a possible way to have a circumbinary disk in an AGB binary system. We took L2 Puppis system as an example and proposed that a short period of high mass loss rate pulsation from the AGB star may lead to such morphology. Besides high mass loss rate, the pulsation should also have sub-escaping speed to let some of the pulsed material be gravitationally bound to the binary system. We used <i>AstroBEAR</i> to carry out the hydrodynamic simulation. Then we exported the data of the simulation and used <i>RADMC3D</i> to generate synthetic images and broad band SED.

The time evolution of binary separations and orbital periods are calculated directly from the averaged mass loss rate, accretion rate and angular momentum loss rate. We separately consider  spin-orbit synchronized and zero spin AGB cases. We find that the the angular momentum carried away by the mass loss together with the mass transfer can effectively shrink the orbit when accretion occurs via wind-Roche-lobe overflow. In contrast,  the larger fraction of mass lost in Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accreting systems  acts to enlarge the orbit. Synchronized binaries tend to experience stronger orbital period decay in close binaries. We also find that orbital period decay is faster when we account for the nonlinear evolution of the accretion mode as the binary starts to tighten. This can increase the fraction of binaries that result in common envelope, luminous red novae, Type Ia supernovae and planetary nebulae with tight central binaries. The results also imply that planets in the the habitable zone around white dwarfs are unlikely to be found.
